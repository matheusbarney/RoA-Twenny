## THE SH0W MUST G0 0N! LIGHTS, CAMERA, FRACTURES!
HXC-020, or "Twenny" for short, is one of the rogue paranormal anomalies from the ever-haunted Ambrosia City. Born from discarded computer software and hardware bathed in haunted sewer waters, Twenny is a unique kind of paranormal lifeform, with electricity for a mind, ectoplasmic acid for blood and a spectral soul. With plenty of control over her angleable bombs and pipes, Twenny pressures her opponents with high plasticity at long ranges.

This character was completed in a month and a half for the ExW 2024 Horror Jam. At the end of the competition, she was ranked second overall out of 30 submissions.
